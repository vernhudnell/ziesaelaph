5 авг 2016  Etwa so muss ein Sonnenuntergang auf Ibiza klingen. »Café del Mar 22« hat wieder einmal den coolsten Soundtrack für heiße Sommerbande. I found myself clicking on the 'hear this' section on my Deezer feed and thought I'd check my recommendations to see if there were anything that jumped out. What I like about going through that section is I can see the albums (as opposed to hearing just the music), and there are times that I find myself giving the music some extra time because I like the album cover.

Для этого отлично подходит уэльская группа Slowly Rolling Camera. So here are some of my thoughts about what I listened to. Disclaimer : Mostly a rock kinda guy, but lately have been heading towards a more folk/acoustic sound. My top albums of 2017: (listened to 29) Laura Marling - Semper Femina It's her 6th album and possibly her best - she keeps evolving her sound and it looks like it's working. The opening track 'Soothing' shows this off perfectly, couldn't stop listening to it. 'Nothing, not Nearly' ends the album. I'm looking to put together a list of album review sites for future reference. So far: - London Jazz News ( - Second Inversion (https://www.secondinversion.org/2018/09/05/sneak-peek-audio-leak-ken-thomsons-sextet/) - Music OMH (https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/snow-patrol-wildness) (68k) Popular sites: - Boing Boing (https://boingboing.net/2018/09/22/lawrences-new-album-liv.html) (9 Million) - Evenin.

Hello everyone, I don't usually post, just lurk, but I figured out that the radio station linked down below actually helps me get through the day and NoFap. This radio station plays Trip-Hop, Downtempo, etc. Songs are for the most part sung by women, and I noticed that they are somehow rewiring my brain into not thinking about women just in terms of sex. Now that I think about it, the radio station might be a form of propaganda, so be careful. :D The Best Trip Hop Radio Station He was in the lineup of 205 Live guys on the debut episode, but he definitely hasn't had a match on the show. He's been wrestling on the occasional NXT house show in Florida, but it's strange that a guy that went to the finals of the CWC isn't on tv yet. Didn't he also have a "coming soon" video. 
I was sitting at the nurse’s station, reading trashy tabloids and drinking coffee when Olga -- the other nurse on duty -- poked my arm. “The little girl escaped,” she said, with a giggle. “What?” She pointed to the security camera feed. Little Madeline was standing in the hallway, her image grainy and pixelated. We’d admitted Madeline at 8:23 PM. A little girl, no more than six. Her face covered in blood. She’d taken a nasty fall down the stairs. Dr. Thompson was worried she might develop. I see a lot of misinformation float around this sub about dice, and ea - and who does this and who's responsible for that. I write this post in an attempt to clear up once and for all , the process in which how games are created - and updated. I am happy to provide proof of my said employment to any moderators I did not work for DICE - I worked for Blackbox (Also known as EA Canada). The process between all studios was the same. I cannot speak to how things A little background on this story. First, I have a fairly decent car for it being so old (16 year old Dodge Neon SE) and I have zero interest in getting anything different since it's reliable, still gets great gas mileage, is completely paid off and handles great. It's blue with a massive rust spot on the rear passenger side just above the gas tank, but I don't care. (It gives the car character, you know?) Second, this story takes place in Michigan, where as anyone who lives here or has driven. ( a few people told me to post this on a more nuclear level revenge, so hopefully it covers all the rules) Edit: Jessus, thank you so much for the Gold ! I have never had one and this is so cool, you are eigher very kind or very horrible for enabling my bad habbits ahah XD. I'll make sure to ping you when I post more stories :) Edit 2: Thank you so much for another gold ! I'll make sure I spread those coins and make other peoples day !

I was so lost and confused and had no idea what was going on, blind to that deep voice buried down in my gut telling me something was definitely off. Well, on February 22, I found his old phone tucked in the side pocket of the car and I brought it inside to charge it.

They seem to be becoming increasingly beloved in the West… and hey, what’s not to love? Before we get into it though, let’s just make sure we’re on the same page real quick. See, there’s a lot of different Baozi variants. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into three main categories: 1. Leavened Baozi (发面包子). These kinds of Baozi are fluffy and light.

What my bodycam saw at Whispering Oaks-Part One (https://redd.it/bcisk2) When I finished watching that video, I immediately tried to download it from the card to the computer’s hard drive.
