Just as in the title.I flashed LineageOS on my phone, without Gapps at all, and getting the hang of it. I already host my own data with several VMs hosting apps, so I'm mostly ok. A new one I haven't deal yet with.how do I change LineageOS internal DNS? I mean, with Wifi it might still get my DHCP's settings, but with the 3G network it will get my provider's. I'd like to have my own encrypted DNS, ala 1.1.1.1 or simliar. What should I do to change it?

How does DNS blocking work on Android? I have enabled it and can see that it's blocking ads, but can't work out where it's getting it's block list from? I'm using the system default DNS resolvers. I used some DNS ad block lists on the iOS AdGuard app previously, and would like to use them here too. I tried adding one to the user filter page, but it doesn't seem to have worked (despite being turned on and listed).

There are two DNS servers, a local IPv4 one (192.168.1.230) and an ISP IPv6 one (2a01:e00::1) The IPv4 DNS server knows about the local domain, the IPv6 one doesn't. Android happens to use the IPv6 DNS server, and so can't resolve the hosts in the local network. This matches what I am seeing with my configuration.

So I use Netguard on stock android (I know, big no-no, but there's no lineage support for my devices) but still want a way to change my DNS cause that will give me some added privacy benefits without having to lose my Netguard access for a new 'VPN' access on the phone. Is there anyway to directly change the DNS to something (OpenDNS or Cloud flare, or something else). If it helps, I have a Samsung galaxy. Change Android DNS settings With These 5 DNS Changer Apps Gaurav Bidasaria April 17, 2018 Internet When you type ‚Äì www.google.com on your web browser, your smartphone asks the DNS server for the corresponding IP address where that site is located and once it has that information, you are able to open Google on your browser. 
I have an unrooted/unmodified Pixel 2 with the latest Oreo security patches. I also use the DDG browser as my default. Going to ipleak.net with the ProtonVPN app, all my DNS servers (all 50 of them apparently?) reverse lookup (whois.arin.net) to Google. If I use the Windscribe app, the DNS resolves to just the Windscribe VPN DNS. I feel that using Google DNS is obviously a security hole. Can anyone explain this behavior to me, please. Since yesterday I start using it, everything works well but I am confused about the "DNS" settings on my android. I have checked on the Internet and it says, if the "Filter DNS request" is ON, then the filtering effect is lower. From my understanding, "lower effect" means all apps now would go through DNS filtering "first" then "VPN", the only problem is it may lead some apps conflicts, am I right? If I still let VPN run, all ads would still get filtered after DNS-filtering, and performance. I've just setup my first PiHole setup today. So far I have it setup and running on 192.168.0.21. So I set it as my DNS inside my android phone (v7.0) and it was doing nothing. So I tried it on my Ubuntu Box and it worked perfect. Now I set all the DNS settings back to automatic and just changed the DNS on my router to the pihole box 192.168.0.21. Now I get that DNS automatically on all devices that connect to the network. So now it still works great on my ubuntu box.

Hey everyone, I've been using my Galaxy S8+ for about 2 months now, and I've been facing an issue that I guess must have popped up within the last few weeks because I can't seem to remember it happening when I first purchased the phone. I will experience random reboots anywhere from instantly to within 2-3 minutes of the phone booting up (When I can see the home screen). It happens more often than not, and sometimes it will happen successively one right after the other a few times until 
Hi everyone, I am a beginner in networks and not a native English speaker, so I apologise for any mistakes or dumb questions. After successfully setting up Pi-hole in my RPi3 and confirming the localhost requests are being piholed, I could not make the DNS settings work in the router my ISP provided (Humax hgb10r-02). All the traffic goes through Pi-hole, as I can see all the requests from different clients, but the internet stays down (to my wife horror) as the names are not resolved So, it was recently discovered that Google is planning on implementing DNS on TLS to encrypt DNS traffic on Android. My question is, how would the effect my PiHole's effectiveness on my Android device?

I have a site help.company.com which has a CNAME pointing to company.groovehq.com. Groovehq is hosting this site. Problem is, help.company.com ONLY loads on desktops and Apple products. No Android phone is capable of loading that site. I'm told its a DNS problem? Is there something I dont know about DNS? Did I miss some Android DNS setting? If it resolves and loads on desktops and iphones, how can it be a DNS problem? APPARENTLY ANDROID DOESNT LIKE HTTP://COMPANY.GROOVEHQ.COM BUT EVERYONE. 
I'm a proud Visionary user and have been since day one. As part of liking my privacy I use ProtonVPN, and have up until now resorted to rooting my phone to get the pleasure of native adblocking within Android with Adaway writing to my hosts file. In another sub, a developer (rightly so) advocates that rooting is a security risk beyond measure. Which is correct. However, as things are now, I don't see any solutions on how to natively block ads, while still using ProtonVPN. There are non-root. Hi all, This is motivated by this earlier post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/bkxmb2/how\_to\_enter\_ip\_address\_to\_android\_9\_private\_dns/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/bkxmb2/how_to_enter_ip_address_to_android_9_private_dns/) Basically, I have a PiHole with a static IP address (hardened VPS) and want to point my Android phone (version 9) to it at all times, even when it is on 4G. I thought I could do it with Private DNS, but it turns Pretty much the title says it all. Android 9 has the "private dns" setting, but it expects dns hostname, which to me sounds like a very weird thing to ask. DNs servers have IP adresses not hostnames. Does anyone know how this feature works and how I can add a DNS providers IP address there. </p>
