I have a high powered Chromebook, I don’t want to touch Linux and it’s 2019. There must be a way to install Reaper on Chromebooks by now without having to touch Linux. Any new developments in this area? I do have a Windows Laptop that I only keep for Reaper and nothing else, but I like my Chromebook much better.

Hey all, I'm about to move back to Linux on my desktop. Manjaro specifically. I've tried and failed many times in the past to get Ardour, working on Linux machines, but now I'm coming back to the desktop with a load of Linux server experience, so maybe I'll fare better.
