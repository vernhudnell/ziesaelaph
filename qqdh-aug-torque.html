Most engineers who deal with bolted joints are familiar with torque tables for SAE-grade bolts, but these are all too often used without regard Knowing the load profile (speed range, torque and power) is es- sential when selecting a suitable motor and frequency converter for the application. Awesome, thanks man this is exactly what I needed. The kit came with new u-bolts so I should be OK there, I did a search and found torque specs 
Understanding the nut factor, which relates threaded-fastener torque and tension, can help engineers design more-reliable bolted joints.
